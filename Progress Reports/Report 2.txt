We created the database design and implemented following backend APIs using Play framework :

/login                         - for login
/signup                      - for signup
/organizations          - for getting a list of organizations
/organizations/:id    - for getting a list of events for organization with given id

For the front end, we are developing the pages using AngularJS and calling the API.
We also looked into using Firebase for authentication.
We will be looking into creating the remaining APIs and integrating it with the front end. 
We also looked into using Socket.io for implementing the chat.
