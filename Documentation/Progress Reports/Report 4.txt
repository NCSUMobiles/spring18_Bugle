We are mostly done with the back-end. We changed the database from sqlite to psql since sqlite is just in memory database and the data got reset every time the server went to sleep.

We created the following Pages in the Front End:
- Volunteer.html (Volunteer Home Page)
- Organization.html (OrganizationHome Page)
- approveVolunteer.html (approve volunteer page)
- Session implementation with login and logout functionality.

In The front end, We are working on the following pages:
- Profile Page
- Event Details Page (CSS part is left)
- API calls from the front end for apply event, create event, edit profile, approve/reject volunteers.
- Chat Page.
